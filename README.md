Title: WordPress Infrastructure on Azure

Introduction
This technical document outlines the process of setting up a WordPress infrastructure on Microsoft Azure. The goal is to create a highly available, scalable, and secure environment for hosting a WordPress website.

Infrastructure Components
The following components will be used to create the WordPress infrastructure on Azure:

a. Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)
b. Azure Database for MySQL
c. Azure Load Balancer
d. Azure Storage
e. Azure CDN
f. Azure Security Center
g. Azure Backup

Infrastructure Design

3.1. Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)

Create two or more VMs to host the WordPress application in different availability zones.
Choose a suitable VM size according to the expected traffic and resource requirements.
Install the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack on each VM.
3.2. Azure Database for MySQL

Set up an Azure Database for MySQL instance to store the WordPress data.
Enable automatic backups, monitoring, and scaling according to your needs.
Configure the VMs to connect to the Azure Database for MySQL instance.
3.3. Azure Load Balancer

Create an Azure Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic across the VMs.
Configure health probes to monitor the VMs and ensure high availability.
Set up load balancing rules to distribute traffic based on a specific algorithm (e.g., round-robin).
3.4. Azure Storage

Set up Azure Blob Storage to store media files and other static content.
Configure the WordPress application to use the Azure Storage Account for media uploads.
Set up the necessary permissions and access keys for secure access.
3.5. Azure CDN

Create an Azure CDN profile to cache and deliver static content from the Azure Blob Storage.
Configure the WordPress application to use the CDN for serving static assets.
Set up custom domain mapping and SSL certificates for the CDN.
3.6. Azure Security Center

Enable Azure Security Center for continuous monitoring and threat protection.
Set up custom security policies and alerts for the WordPress infrastructure.
Regularly review security recommendations and take necessary actions.
3.7. Azure Backup

Configure Azure Backup to create regular backups of the VMs and database.
Set up backup retention policies and schedules according to your requirements.
Test and validate the backup and restore process.
Implementation

Create the necessary resources on Azure following the design mentioned in section 3.
Configure the resources according to the requirements.
Test the setup by deploying a WordPress application and verifying its functionality.
Monitoring and Maintenance

Set up Azure Monitor to track the performance and health of the infrastructure.
Configure alerts and notifications for critical issues.
Regularly review logs, performance metrics, and security recommendations.
Update the WordPress application, plugins, and infrastructure components as required.
Conclusion
This technical document provides a blueprint for creating a scalable, secure, and highly available WordPress infrastructure on Azure. By following these guidelines, you can ensure the smooth operation of your WordPress website and provide a great user experience for your visitors.
